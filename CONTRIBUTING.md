# Contribution Guidelines

Ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

1. **If you just created something, wait at least 30 days before submitting.** This is to give it some time to mature and ensure it's not just a publish-and-forget type of project.
2. The pull request should have a useful title and include a link to the project and why it should be included.

Thank you for your suggestion!
